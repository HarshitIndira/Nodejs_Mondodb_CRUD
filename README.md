# CRUD operation in node.js with MongoDB

 In this project I have performed CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation in MongoDb using node.js for which I have created to files index.js and dbconnect.js-

 In dbconnect.js- created separate file for establishing connection with database so that no need to write connection code again and again and export it to use in other files

 In index.js - Write code in node.js to perfom CRUD Operation using concepts such as functions, modules, async-await
